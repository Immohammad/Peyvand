This repository contains the frontend code for my bachelor project. The detailed version of the explanation, Analysis, Design and implementaion is found in `BCP_FinalReport_Mohammad Movahedinia.pdf` file, which is written in Persian.<br/>
The backend of this project is available [here](https://github.com/RezaKlhor/SBUhamkari) and The whole project is deployed on https://peyvandsbu.netlify.app (It is better to use vpn).

## Abstract
A person's aliveness is manifested by making changes in his living environment and the most important responsibility of an engineer is to make a better world by solving existing problems.\
With this assumption we decided to choose our bachelor project find a solution for a problem in Shahid Beheshti University.\
A problem that came to our mind without much thought was the lack of a centralized and efficient platform to create links between students, professors and companies present in the university. Beheshti University, due to its eleven faculties in the central campus, can be the leader in interdisciplinary researchs and the connection between the university and the industry.\
But so far no action has been taken to use this capacity. Students need other students for team building. They tend to work with professors to strengthen their resumes and Implement their ideas through the growth center. Professors for some of research and projects need students. Also The growth center units need students and professors in different fields. With all this said, currently this communication is done through informal ways such as searching and visiting in person, scattered announcements in academic channels and the like. Therefore, we decided to design a system that can integrate these mutual needs and solve the mentioned need by providing some features like Create research and teacher assistant situation, declaring need of cooperation, Observing the ongoing and finished researchs in the university and getting to know the activists of different research fields. So the main goal of this system is networking for researchs and startup activities within the university. In this report, we will review the design and implementation of the front-end of the mentioned system with ReactJS. The back-end implementation of this system is done by my good friend, Reza Kalhori.
